[Ivan] FM plans to kidnap senator Bolden. As you know, the senator is the most influential politician in Brain City. 
m7_brf_ivan_1_02
As of now, their motives are unclear. Perhaps they want the city to pay a ransom.  On the other hand, they may just want to assassinate him.
m7_brf_ivan_1_03
Both outcomes would wreak havoc on the senate.
m7_brf_ivan_2_01
[Ivan] Of course. However, there is a limit to what kind of protection we can provide. FM is a huge group. 
m7_brf_ivan_2_02
We would need to send most of our troupes to stop them. This would leave the city’s defenses wide open. You’re the only ones who can stop them.
m7_brf_ivan_2_03
During the mission, senator Bolden will be held at a remote location under the city’s protection. You will face FM alone.
m7_brf_ivan_3_01
[Ivan] The senator's movements are easily tracked since his schedule is available to the public. 
m7_brf_ivan_3_02
We can use this to our advantage and lure the enemy to us. One of you will drive the senator’s car and pretend to be him.

There’s one more detail that may be of interest to you. This operation is being led by Geil. 
m7_brf_ivan_4_01
[Ivan] It seems I’ve caught your interest. Geil aims to use this opportunity to demonstrate his strength and gain the respect of his men. 
m7_brf_ivan_4_02
Unlike Gibler, it seems like Geil likes to be a part of the action.
m7_brf_ivan_4_03
Watch out for him.
m7_brf_ivan_5_01
[Ivan] The advance for this mission is 15,000 Credit. Break a leg.
m7_brf_jun_1_01
[June] If he is such an important person, shouldn’t he already be well guarded?
m7_brf_rod_1_01
[Rodrigo] Alright. I’ll play the hero this time.
m7_brf_rod_2_01
[Rodrigo] Hey, Jin. I'll be in the car.
m7_brf_rod_3_01
[Rodrigo] It’s alright. I’ve always wanted to ride in a nice car.
m7_brf_yuitz_1_01
[Jin] That's an obvious bait. Will FM be so easily fooled?
m7_brf_yuitz_2_01
[Jin] Geil?
m7_brf_yuitz_3_01
[Jin] What’s the advance for this mission?
m7_brf_yuitz_4_01
[Jin] I have a feeling this one is going to be dangerous.
