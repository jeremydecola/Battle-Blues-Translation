[Ivan] We've received a request for personal protection. The individual to be protected is Jack Wiseman. 
m5_brf_ivan_1_02 
It would appear that he is being pursued by FM. Jack took refuge inside a factory on 32nd Street in the Kan district. 
m5_brf_ivan_1_03 
Your mission is to rescue Jack and escort him to safety. We have reason to believe that he may be a double agent.
m5_brf_ivan_1_04 
If you are unable to rescue him, get rid of him instead. The advance for this mission is 12 000 Credit. Good luck.

m5_brf_rod_2_01 
[Rodrigo] Jack and I have a little bit of a history. I owe him quite a bit.
