[Hans] Perhaps this is just a political stunt.  He wants to show off his military strength.

[June] What news?

[June] The previous Senator was just murdered. Why would Ivan put himself in danger like this?

[June] His presence here accomplishes absolutely nothing.

[Simon] Why did General Ivan have to tag along? He's only getting in our way.

[Simon] With Senator Bolden and my father dead, he was the logical next person in line.
