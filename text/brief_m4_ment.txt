[B.B.] We should make use of traps. Everyone, bring as many as you can.
m4_brf_bill_1_01 
[Bill] This'll be a breeze. With more men on our side, we're less likely to get hit. 
m4_brf_ivan_1_01 
[Ivan] We've received reports that FM will attack the Capitol.
m4_brf_ivan_1_02
The Capitol is a symbol of the State's power. If the Capitol is damaged, so is the government's credibility and image.
m4_brf_ivan_1_03 
The advance for this mission will be 18 000 Credit. 
m4_brf_ivan_1_04 
This is a delicate matter for the state, so Brain City's defense force will be fighting alongside you.
m4_brf_ivan_2_01 
[Ivan] I'm fully aware of your capabilities but, as I said, this one is personal.
m4_brf_ivan_2_02 
If the city's defense force just stands by while you do all the work, our citizens will be furious.
m4_brf_ivan_2_03 
Please try to understand our position as well. We decided to offer a little more Credit than usual as compensation. 
m4_brf_ivan_3_01 
[Ivan] That's right. You'll be accompanied by an elite group of soldiers known as "Wind Tooth".
m4_brf_ivan_3_02 
Jin, I take it you've met General Herman?
m4_brf_ivan_4_01 
[Ivan] We don't know how many men FM sent out to the Capitol but, it's clear that they'll be sending their best unit.
m4_brf_ivan_4_02
What we do know is that they will try to flank us. The main force will attack from the left side and the rest of their men, from the right. 
m4_brf_ivan_4_03 
This is a perfect opportunity to test your skills, so take charge of the left side. 
m4_brf_ivan_4_04 
It goes without saying, the other soldiers will cover the right side.
m4_brf_ivan_4_05
Cooperate with each other and get the job done. 
m4_brf_rod_1_01 
[Rodrigo] Hmph. They don't think we can handle it. 
m4_brf_yuitz_1_01 
[Jin] By any chance, are the soldiers that will be fighting with us General Herman's men?
m4_brf_yuitz_2_01
[Jin] Hmm... I don't know about that. 
m4_brf_yuitz_3_01
[Jin] Do we have a head count on the enemy? 
m4_brf_yuitz_4_01 
[Jin] We may be outnumbered this time, so prepare yourselves thoroughly.
