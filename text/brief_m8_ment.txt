[B.B.] Okidoki!

[Ivan] Yesterday evening, Senator Bolden was found dead in his home. 
m8_brf_ivan_2_01
[Ivan] No, it's someone who's been by your side this whole time.
m8_brf_ivan_3_01
[Ivan] Right. It was Rodrigo's doing. I don't know what his reasons are, but he seems to have sided with FM.
m8_brf_ivan_3_02
You had no idea? Jin, if this is how you manage your team, it doesn't reflect very well on your skill as a captain.
m8_brf_ivan_4_01
[Ivan] In any case, we've located FM's base.
m8_brf_ivan_4_02
They operate from a 20-story energy tower on Slam Street. I want you to destroy the tower and close off the area. 
m8_brf_ivan_4_03
FM is very spread out, but if you destroy their base, they will eventually fall apart.
m8_brf_ivan_4_04
Your advance for this mission is 20 000 Credit. Make each Credit count. 
m8_brf_ivan_5_01
[Ivan] Don't worry. It's been decommissioned since 2010.
m8_brf_ivan_6_01
[Ivan] That information is classified. I'm sorry.
m8_brf_jun_1_01
[June] General Ivan, donâ€™t you think you went a bit too far there? 
m8_brf_jun_2_01
[June] No way. It's an older spherical-type tower, there will be a huge explosion! How would we protect surrounding civilians from the blast?
m8_brf_ray_1_01
[Ray] Alright! B.B! Blow it up!
m8_brf_yuitz_1_01
[Jin] He still ended up dead. Great... Who did it? FM?
m8_brf_yuitz_2_01
[Jin] Don't tell me... Rodrigo?!
m8_brf_yuitz_3_01
[Jin] ...
m8_brf_yuitz_4_01
[Jin] Energy is already scarce enough these days... can we really afford to blow up the tower? What do we gain from doing this?
