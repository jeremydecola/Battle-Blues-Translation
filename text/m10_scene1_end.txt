[Bill] Ivan... That son of a bitch! I hated him from the start.

[Bill] Don’t even think about being a hero. We still have a score to settle.

[Bill] What the hell are you doing? Captain!

[Eric] W-we’ve m-made it all this way...

[June] We’ll all make it out in one piece, I’m sure of it!

[Yuang] Are you kidding? Captain!
yuan_2_01
[Yuang] What are you talking about?! We are a team!

[Jin] As you probably have figured out by now, General Ivan has betrayed us.
yuitz_2_01
[Jin] I won’t sugar coat it, our situation is looking pretty grim. We may not be able to leave with our lives.

[Jin] I’m disbanding Team Blue. I'm no longer your captain, so I won't judge you if you leave now.
yuitz_4_01
[Jin] Guys...
yuitz_5_01
[Jin] June, I want to thank you for everything you’ve done until now.

[Jin] Someone must survive and keep our memory alive. We are only truly dead if we are forgotten. Let’s fight to the end, Team Blue!
