[B.B.] All of the explosives currently being manufactured are R-Series so we shouldn't have much to worry about. 
m3_brf_bb_2_01
[B.B.] Of course. 
m3_brf_ivan_1_01
[Ivan] We've received a report indicating that FM has planted a bomb in the K2 building; a 100-story skyscraper in the downtown area.
m3_brf_ivan_1_02
We believe the bomb was planted somewhere between the 55th and 57th floor. 
m3_brf_ivan_1_03 
If the bomb goes off, it will most likely take out the neighboring energy tower and paralyze the entire city's defense system.
m3_brf_ivan_2_01 
[Ivan] Of course. A defense system called AADS was enforced on all surrounding buildings.
m3_brf_ivan_2_02 
However, FM is aware of the system's design flaws and has taken advantage of its vulnerabilities. 
m3_brf_ivan_3_01 
[Ivan] The Auto Arms Detecting System, or AADS for short, is a state-of-the-art defense system 
designed to protect from terrorist bombings. 
m3_brf_ivan_3_02 
The problem is that when the system was built, it was only designed to protect from explosives produced after 2005. 
m3_brf_ivan_3_03 
If it isn't an R-Series explosive produced after 2005, it will go completely undetected. 
m3_brf_ivan_4_01 
[Ivan] FM took advantage of this design flaw to smuggle in old bombs. 
m3_brf_ivan_4_02 
B.B., have you ever heard of "plastic bombs"?
m3_brf_ivan_5_01 
[Ivan] FM combined advanced digital equipment to produce plastic bombs and have installed them throughout the building. 
m3_brf_ivan_5_02 
Plastic bombs are undetectable by the AADS and pack 5% the explosive force of R-Series bombs.
m3_brf_ivan_5_03 
However, if enough of them are used, it should be more than enough to take down the building. 
m3_brf_ivan_6_01 
[Ivan] If the energy tower explodes, more than 70% of the city's power will be lost. 
m3_brf_ivan_6_02 
As a result, 80% percent of the city's defense system will go offline. 
m3_brf_ivan_7_01 
[Ivan] The plastic bombs are on a timer and the enemy is in possession of the detonator.
They waited and ambushed the bomb demolition squad.
m3_brf_ivan_7_02 
According to the media, one of the platoons we sent out as well as the bomb demolition squad have both been annihilated. 
The second wave
m3_brf_ivan_7_03 
of engineers sent in to dismantle the bombs are taking refuge in front of the main gate. Your mission is to protect the 3 remaining 
m3_brf_ivan_7_04
engineers long enough for them to defuse the explosives. The bombs are set to detonate 3 hours from now. 
m3_brf_ivan_7_05 
The advance for this mission is 10 000 Credit. Good luck. 
m3_brf_jun_1_01 
[June] Apart from the bombs, how did they manage to smuggle weapons into the K2 building?
m3_brf_yuitz_1_01 
[Jin] It's already all over the media...
m3_brf_yuitz_1_02 
If this energy tower is powering the whole city's defense system, 
shouldn't it have its own defense system?
m3_brf_yuitz_2_01 
[Jin] Vulnerabilities?
m3_brf_yuitz_3_01 
[Jin] If the energy tower does collapse, how much of the city's power grid will be affected?
m3_brf_yuitz_4_01 
[Jin] We'd better hurry then. What's the current situation? 
m3_brf_yuitz_5_01 
[Jin] No time to worry about that. Everyone get ready, we're leaving.
