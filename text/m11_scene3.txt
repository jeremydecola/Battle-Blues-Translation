[Bill] FM? What the hell is he talking about?

[Haberac] Who are you guys? You're not with the police. Did FM send you here?

m1_open_habe_2-01"
[Haberac] I have nothing to discuss with FM scum like you. Stop disturbing my work and get out of my face.

m1_open_habe_3-01"
[Haberac] Depends on what you mean by "release". You're free to take the corpses of the ones I don't need. 

m1_open_habe_4-01"
[Haberac] Haha, alright! If an early funeral is what you want, come and get it.

[Rodrigo] Hmm, that's not going to work. We can only make money by disturbing you.

[Jin] Will you release all the hostages if we comply with your demands?

m1_open_team_2-01"
[Jin] I appreciate your honesty, but things won't go your way.
