[Bill] Damn it, seems like everyone's our enemy here. 
m4_open_bill_2_01 
[Bill] It's been a while since I let loose. 
m4_open_her_1_01 
[General Herman] Well look who we have here. 
m4_open_her_2_01 
[General Herman] They're like puppets. 
m4_open_her_3_01 
[General Herman] Why? Did I say something wrong? So what do you call guys who have no real conviction and would do just about anything for money?
m4_open_her_4_01
[General Herman] Give it up, Simon. They aren't worth your breath.  
m4_open_her_5_01 
[General Herman] Right. Let's give it a rest for now. We'll handle the right side of the building. 
m4_open_her_5_02
I'm not sure about leaving things over here in your hands. For your sake, I hope you're as competent as you think you are. 
m4_open_her_5_03 
Do me a favor and make sure we don't ever meet again after this fight. 
m4_open_her_5_04 
Teaming up with the likes of you really hurts my pride.
m4_open_rod_1_01 
[Rodrigo] What?!
m4_open_rod_2_01 
[Rodrigo] Hey, here's a question for your gramps : If you're such noble soldiers, why did you hire us?
m4_open_rod_2_02 
Too weak to handle this yourselves. Really speaks volumes about the quality of men that enlist with you.
m4_open_rod_3_01 
[Rodrigo] "Wind Tooth". What kind of name is that? Are you a bunch of dentists? You guys even enlist kids now? Did he pick the name?
m4_open_rod_4_01
[Rodrigo] Fuck, they're using us as cannon fodder!
m4_open_simon_1_01 
[Simon] Father, who are these people?
m4_open_simon_2_01 
[Simon] Hey, punk! Watch what you say with that mouth.  Who are you calling weak?
m4_open_simon_2_02 
Wind Tooth is the strongest unit in the city's defense force. 
m4_open_simon_3_01 
[Simon] What?! 
m4_open_yuan_1_01 
[Yuang] Were you expecting a bouquet of roses or something? 
m4_open_yuitz_1_01 
[Jin] General Herman, I know you're eager to get this over with and get rid of us.
m4_open_yuitz_1_02 
However, we have a battle to fight. This is no time to be at each other's throats. 
m4_open_yuitz_2_01 
[Jin] Forget about what General Herman said. Our job is to protect this side of the Capitol. 
m4_open_yuitz_2_02 
The majority of the enemy forces will come from our side so stay sharp.
m4_open_yuitz_3_01 
[Jin] The enemy has begun attacking. Everyone be careful.
